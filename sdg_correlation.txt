    https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/unsdg
    
    - Goal 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls
        Target 5.5: Ensure women's full and effective participation and equal 
        opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making in 
        political, economic and public life
        
        --> Indicator 5.5.2: Proportion of women in managerial positions (%)
    
    - Goal 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern 
        energy for all
        Target 7.2: By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable 
        energy in the global energy mix
        
        --> Indicator 7.2.1: Renewable energy share in the total final energy consumption (%)


2018 is the most recent year for goal 7 and both goals have sufficient data for this year. Therefore, this year is selected.


Lilliefors results Goal 5: (0.07731910636894324, 0.21535038152401192)
The correlation is not statistically significant, as the p-value is: 0.2154.

Lilliefors results Goal 7: (0.1339910250281786, 0.0009999999999998899)
The correlation is statistically significant at a level of 0.01.

The results of the Spearman's R test are: 

Correlation: -0.0858
P-value: 0.4293
The correlation is not statistically significant, as the p-value is: 0.4293.

The results indicate that there is probably no relation between the percentage of population with electricity access and the 
proportion of women in managerial positions.

If the result had been significant, there would have been a slight trade-off between the SDGs. Although the indicators are very different 
and based upon many different factors, it could make more sense if the indicators were positively correlated, because both indicate some 
kind of positive development which is strived for by most countries. Therefore, it seems logical that the measured trade-off is very insignificant.
The means of the goals are 33.03% and 22.50%.

The world map shows a very scattered distribution of countries in which one, both, or neither of the targets is met. Meeting the target here means scoring 
above the mean of that goal within all selected countries. No patterns can be noticed from this map either, which is in line with previous results.
