Course:         Sustainability Analysis in Python
Author:         Marron Loods
Coordinator:    Laura Scherer
Date:           November 9, 2021


Reading guide:
    
    - Code cells are numbered based on the assignment tasks
    - Tasks are listed in order except for:
        - Task 8: Radio button, which is commented out in cell 4d.1. The 
            section between #### can be commented in to enable the radio 
            button, but the cells below need to be run manually afterwards.
        - Task 9: 
            a-d Done throughout entire code
            e Code documentation automatically generated through Sphinx
        - Task 10
    - Code commented out in current file for legibility:
        - 2b.1 Tables with count of data points per year in cell 
        - 3b Sanity test to check whether the lists of countries are identical
        - 4b.1 First scatterplot
        - 4c.1 Table with outliers 

Disclaimers:
    - GUI not placed in different file
    - On my computer, the working directory file keeps changing. Therefore, I 
        made a variable current_folder. If current_folder = '' does not work,
        please copy-paste the relative path name of the folder in which the
        files are downloaded, to ensure that all files are found.
    - When you close the window in which you select the correlation coefficient,
        Python gives the error "SystemExit: 0"
    - Sometimes, the following warning is shown:
        "Figures now render in the Plots pane by default. To make them also 
        appear inline in the Console, uncheck "Mute Inline Plotting" under the 
        Plots pane options menu."
        Please follow those instructions if wanted 
        (Go to Plots, probaby in top right pane > Click on hamburger menu in top
         right corner > Uncheck Mute inline plotting)
    - To practice with writing code documentation, this has been done for three
        functions only: significance, correlation_test, and target_reached

Accompanying files:
    - functions.py
    - Data files (MS Excel): 'Goal5' (renamed after download), 
                             'Goal7' (renamed after download),
                             'TOTAL_POPULATION_BOTH_SEXES',   
                             'UNSD â€” Methodology
    All other files are generated while running code, but also submitted via BS                       

Steps taken from anaconda prompt:
    - New environment created and activated
    - Install: Spyder
    - Install: statsmodels, matplotlib, openpyxl, sphinx
    - Install (after previous installations!) geopandas
