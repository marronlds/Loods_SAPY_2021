The Spearman's R test is performed. This test is non-parametric.
The results of the test are: 

Correlation: -0.0858
P-value: 0.4293
The result is not statistically significant, as the p-value is: 0.4293.

The results indicate that there is probably no relation between the percentage of population with electricity access and the 
proportion of women in managerial positions.

If the result had been significant, there would have been a slight trade-off between the SDGs. Although the indicators are very different 
and based upon many different factors, it could make more sense if the indicators were positively correlated, because both indicate some 
kind of positive development which is strived for by most countries. Therefore, it seems logical that the measured trade-off is very insignificant.
