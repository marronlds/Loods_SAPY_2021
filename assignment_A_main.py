Course:         Sustainability Analysis in Python
Author:         Marron Loods
Coordinator:    Laura Scherer
Date:           November 9, 2021


Reading guide:
    
    - For the full description of this assignment see SAPY_assignment.pdf
        in the folder of this code.
    - Code cells are numbered based on the assignment tasks.
    - Tasks are listed in order except for:
        - Task 8: Radio button, which is commented out in cell 4d.1. The 
            section between #### can be commented in to enable the radio 
            button, but the cells below need to be run manually afterwards.
            It is therefore recommended to run the entire code first, then 
            uncomment the commented code in cell 4d.1, rerun cell 4d.1 to make
            a selection, and finally rerun 4d.2 to read the new results in the
            console.
        - Task 9: 
            a-d Done throughout entire code.
            e Code documentation automatically generated through Sphinx.
        - Task 10
    - Code commented out in current file to avoid spamming console/files:
        - 2b.1 Tables with count of data points per year in cell 
        - 3b Sanity test to check whether the lists of countries are identical
        - 4b.1 First scatterplot savefig
        - 4b.2 Boxplot savefig
        - 4c.1 Table with outliers 
        - 4c.2 New scatterplot with outliers in color savefig

Disclaimers:

    - GUI not placed in different file                                              ### QUESTION IN CLASS
    - On my computer, the working directory file keeps changing. Therefore, I 
        made a variable current_folder. If current_folder = '' does not work,
        please copy-paste the relative path name of the folder in which the 
        current file is stored, to ensure that all files are found.
    - When you close the window in which you select the correlation coefficient,
        Python gives the error "SystemExit: 0"
    - After selecting with the GUI, the rest of the code needs to be rerun          ### QUESTION IN CLASS
    - Sometimes, the following warning is shown:
        "Figures now render in the Plots pane by default. To make them also 
        appear inline in the Console, uncheck "Mute Inline Plotting" under the      ### QUESTION IN CLASS
        Plots pane options menu."
        Please follow those instructions if wanted 
        (Go to Plots, probaby in top right pane > Click on hamburger menu in top
         right corner > Uncheck Mute inline plotting)
    - To practice with writing code documentation, this has been done for three
        functions only: significance, correlation_test, and target_reached
    - Statistical test results are not rounded in the console or Results.txt

Accompanying files:
    
    - functions.py
    - Data files (MS Excel): 'Goal5' (renamed after download), 
                             'Goal7' (renamed after download),
                             'TOTAL_POPULATION_BOTH_SEXES',   
                             'UNSD â€” Methodology
    All other files are generated while running code, but also submitted via BS                       

Steps taken from anaconda prompt:
    
    - New environment created and activated
    - Install: Spyder
    - Install: statsmodels, matplotlib, openpyxl, sphinx
    - Install (after previous installations!) geopandas

are the ones that take more than 0.01 second to run. It is visible that this 
regards plots and data imports. Considering this consists of importing or

slightly more time. 

Other than that, the code cells are written fairly concisely, so further
optimisation is not considered necessary.
